I practiced building a Hospital Management System using ASP.NET Core Web API, following the N-Tier Architecture.
I implemented a Generic Repository Pattern to manage entities like Patient, Doctor, Clinic, and Reservation with reusable CRUD operations.
I also practiced search, pagination, and filtering features to handle data efficiently and improve API performance.
